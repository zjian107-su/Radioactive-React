# 📋 Use Case: Todo Application

# 📝 Description:
You have been tasked with building a Todo application using React. The application should allow users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. Additionally, users should be able to mark tasks as complete or incomplete.

# 🔑 Key Features:

✅ Task Creation: Users should be able to enter a task description and add it to the list of tasks.

📋 Task Listing: The application should display a list of tasks, showing the task description, status (complete/incomplete), and any additional relevant information.

✏️ Task Update: Users should be able to update the task description or mark a task as complete/incomplete.

🗑️ Task Deletion: Users should have the ability to delete a task from the list.

🔍 Task Filtering: Users should be able to filter tasks based on their status (complete/incomplete).

# 📝 Considerations:
To implement this use case, you can follow the following steps and utilize important concepts in React:

🚀 Setup: Create a new React project using a tool like Create React App. Set up the necessary project structure, including components, state management, and routing (if needed).

🏗️ Component Hierarchy: Plan the component hierarchy based on the different features of the application. Break down the UI into reusable components, such as a TodoList component, TodoItem component, TodoForm component, etc.

📊 State Management: Utilize React state to manage the list of tasks, task status, and any other relevant data. Use state hooks like useState to handle state changes and re-renders.

🎯 Event Handling: Implement event handlers to add, update, and delete tasks. Ensure that the UI updates accordingly when actions are performed.

🎭 Conditional Rendering: Use conditional rendering to display different UI elements based on task status, such as showing completed tasks in a different style.

🎨 Styling: Apply CSS or utilize a styling library like styled-components or Material-UI to style the components and create an appealing user interface.

✅ Testing: Write unit tests using a testing framework like Jest or React Testing Library to ensure the components and functionality work as expected.

🚀 Deployment: Deploy the Todo application to a hosting platform like Netlify or Vercel to make it accessible online.
